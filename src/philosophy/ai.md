Don't let AI solve all your problems. That destroy all your resolutive skills, one by one. As
you use more Ai to solve for you everything you will be loosing creativiy ways to solve problems.

Why AI kills creativity and the ability to solve even basic problems?

I mean even you are tented to ask this question to the AI, and you are not letting any space for you to 
participate, and get your hands dirty so to say, you are just an observer. So, if your main purpose is to
be a customer of AI ok do it but if you want to understand and build products or a valuable asset for companies you have to
get your hands dirty. 

How do you be able to repair an engine if you never touch it at all, you only read about it and let some else do it for you?

It is common sense, you will be only limited by what others can do for you. I mean if a company is asking you to solve a problem
quickly you have to use AI as a tool to have the job done, maybe thats what people are actually doing to create their businesses nowadays, but I
think there is at least some valuable income from trying out to solve by yourself first and let the difficult part to AI, isn't it?

Guidelines:

1. Use AI as a teacher when you give up I really you put time on solving the problem by your own.
2. AI is very useful pointing out where is the tooling and how it works.
3. You should be able to write the code with your own hands while thinking about the logic towards the result.
